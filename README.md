# These projects are aimed at carrying out Descriptive and Explorative Data (EDA) Analysis of some datasets, namely:
- ### Biodiversity of animal species at a National Park
- ### U.S. Medical Insurance Costs
- ### Life Expectancy vs GDP of selected countries across the world

## Methodology:
- EDA Techniques used include:
  - Data Inspection
  - Numerical Summarization
  - Data Visualization

## Results and Observations:
- Various visualization techniques will be utilized in exploring the relationship between the categorical and numeric variables. Such as:
  -   Histograms (Univariate Numeric Variables)
  -   Box plots and Bar Charts (Bivariate categorical and numeric variables)
  -   Violin plots and Swarm Charts (Bivariate categorical and numeric variables)
  -   Scatter Plots and Line plots (Bivariate numerical variables)
  -   Facet Grid Plots (Bivariate numerical variables)

## Conclusion:
- Major questions pertaining to the dataset were answered and predictions were made, based on the insights derived from the exploratory data analysis of the datasets.
