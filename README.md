# This project is aimed at carrying out Descriptive and Explorative Data (EDA) Analysis of:
- ### U.S. Medical Insurance Costs
- ### Life Expectancy vs GDP of selected countries across the world

## Methodology:
- EDA Techniques used include:
  - Data Inspection
  - Numerical Summarization
  - Data Visualization

## Results and Observations:
- Various visualization techniques will be utilized in exploring the relationship between the categorical and numeric variables. Such as:
  -   Histograms (Univariate Numeric Variables)
  -   Box plots and Bar Charts (Bivariate categorical and numeric variables)
  -   Violin plots and Swarm Charts (Bivariate categorical and numeric variables)
  -   Scatter Plots and Line plots (Bivariate numerical variables)
  -   Facet Grid Plots (Bivariate numerical variables)

## Conclusion:
- Based on the insights derived from the exploraty data analysis, major questions pertaining to the dataset were answers and predictions were made in tandem.
